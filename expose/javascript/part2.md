## Expose - Part 2

1. At line 12, the numer of prices/items we have will be printed to the console = 3.

2. At line 13, the discounted price of the last item in the list is printed = 150.

3. At line 14, the final price of the last item in the list is printed = 150.

4. This function will return the array `[50, 100, 150]`, which is an array of all the final discounted prices. We start with an empty array. We then start looking at the entires in `prices`, applying the specified discount to them, calculate the `finalPrice` and place it in the corresponding entry in `discounted`.

5. Error: `i` is declared only within the `for` loop block, with `let`. line 12 tries to access it outside of that block and hence an error is thrown.

6. Error: `discountedPrice` is declared only with the `for` loop block. line 12 tries to access it outside of that block and hence an error is thrown.

7. At line 14, the final price of the last item in the list is printed = 150. Here an error isn't thrown since `finalPrice` is declared using `let` in the function block, and so is accessible from line 14.

8. This function will return the array `[50, 100, 150]`, which is an array of all the final discounted prices. We start with an empty array. We then start looking at the entires in `prices`, applying the specified discount to them, calculate the `finalPrice` and place it in the corresponding entry in `discounted`.

9. Error: `i` is declared only within the `for` loop block, with `let`. line 11 tries to access it outside of that block and hence an error is thrown.

10. The length of the `prices` array is printed = 3. This is executed normally since `length` was declared using `const` in the function block, and so is accessible at line 12.

11. This function will return the array `[50, 100, 150]`, which is an array of all the final discounted prices. We start with an empty array. We then start looking at the entires in `prices`, applying the specified discount to them, calculate the `finalPrice` and place it in the corresponding entry in `discounted`.
